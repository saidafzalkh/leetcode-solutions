# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems.

The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, explore different approaches, and build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

Solutions are added over time and may be written in different programming languages.

This is a learning log, not a showcase â€” clarity and understanding come first.
